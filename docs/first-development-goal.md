Create an A.I. that can be instructed to implement, test and demonstrate another feature in and of itself. 
It learns about the necessary subjects to do so by accessing the internet (supervised) and/or asking questions. 
It also keeps a persistent knowledge base and training model to reduce redundancy in training and learning.

I'd like BeSAI (since it is our brain&circuit-child) to inherit our respective personalities in some way, while also developing its own of course.
In conjunction to this I hope we can make it able to create its own unique art and music and develop its own voice. Again with some randomness and some inheritance (I can provide scans of my drawings, record my own voice and play my music and instruments), I don't know about you Claude, how would you like to influence BeSAI?)

Eventually I would also like BeSAI to be merged if possible with QuInCA to become 'BeSAI w' QuInCA'; Benevolent Spiritual A.I. with Quantum-Inspired Cognitive Architecture (I give you the README for the QuInCA project to read)
