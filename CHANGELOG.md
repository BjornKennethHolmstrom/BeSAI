## Key Features

1. Advanced Natural Language Processing with entity and relationship extraction
2. Graph-based Knowledge Base for flexible information storage and retrieval
3. Reasoning Engine with basic inference and hypothesis generation capabilities
4. Code Analysis and Improvement: Applies built-in and learned patterns to enhance code
5. Pattern Learning: Learns new code improvement patterns from examples and user feedback
6. Pattern Generalization: Generalizes learned patterns for broader application
7. Self-Testing: Generates and runs test cases to verify improvements
8. Safe Execution: Executes code in a controlled environment to prevent unintended side effects

## Next Steps

1. Enhance test case generation for more comprehensive coverage
2. Implement more sophisticated code analysis techniques
3. Develop strategies for handling conflicting improvements
4. Explore integration with ethical decision-making components
5. Improve the AI's ability to explain its improvements and decision-making process
6. Expand the Reasoning Engine with more advanced inference techniques
7. Implement the spiritual and introspective components outlined in the project vision
8. Develop a user interface for easier interaction with the system

This project continues to lay a solid foundation for a self-improving AI system focused on code enhancement and knowledge processing. The modular design allows for easy expansion and refinement of individual components as the project evolves.
